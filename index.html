        <p class="lead mb-4" <br> Working at several different jobs during high school, I sometimes found it difficult to maintain a level of work ethic that I am proud of. Overall, the health of my family comes before any other component or section of my busy day-to-day life.  I began my career in fast food at the age of 17 at a newly opened restaurant in my hometown, Raising Caneâ€™s. I was hired because Caneâ€™s was looking for local teenagers to staff their new and state of the art, albeit small and cozy chain.  I worked hard and long hours between the ages of sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen. As I grew more accustomed to attending school for seven hours and then hopping into a seven and a half hour shift. Ideally I would get time off both before and after exam season in order to give myself ample time to study, however it was hard sometimes to  do this. My favorite part of working at Caneâ€™s was the friends I made along the way. While being able to help provide for my family while also getting my education was a part of what makes me proud of myself, I also worked to prove myself as a hard worker to many of the universities I applied to. For my second job I worked in retail. Working in a mall was a fun experience, similar to that of which can be seen in movies of older eras, I was successfully able to work while having fun. My most favorite part of the job was the amount of downtime and time to myself that I was able to experience while working certain hours and positions. I was mainly assigned to be a closer, I would come into work at around 6 pm and leave by 11 after a quick and successful close. I became very skilled at learning how to multitask and learning how managing my time could provide more productivity than I ever could have imagined reaching before that point in time in my life. College has been a fun experience so far, taking classes that are not very hard. I have not had the chance to prove to myself that I can pass more difficult classes such as a math or science course but overall Iâ€™ve found this to be a learning experience that will help me for the rest of my life. Overall, Iâ€™ve worked very hard to achieve my goals and I am proud to be able to study at a four year university because of the financial aid I've been receiving from the United States of America government. I look forward to increasing my knowledge toward all subjects in order to make myself a more proficient and productive student and future worker and business or hospital manager in the future. I hope to graduate in four years, it would certainly save a financial barrier for myself that would come from the dreaded student loans that which many fifths years experience. Thank you very much.</br>
